# TRT

### Testosterone cypionate

Some things to consider:

* The elimination half-life of cypionate is 8 days, meaning, in 8 days it reaches half it’s concentration in your bloodstream, and since excretion happens in a roughly exponential rate you’ll soon be depleted of it.
* Any continuous exogenous testosterone use will shut down your HPTA, your natural production of testosterone from your testis.

That roller coaster is a sure recipe for NASTY sides effects in the long run, because TRT is not a game, it’s FOR LIFE, if you play around with it coming on and off, you’re essentially setting yourself for big problems in the horizon.

Instead, apply the same dosage with a higher frequency, 100mg/week, or 50mg/E3D.

This way you'll never be going to crazy high levels of T and then plummeting down to castrated levels of T because that's the real trouble, your endocrine system works like a delicate dance, you want to keep everything as balanced as possible.

Now, let me assume, that you are a little vain, you want bigger muscles, then, don't worry, with a TRT dosage of 100mg a week, you can build INSANE muscularity if the correct training principles are applied and if you take your time to grow.

You'll not balloon up like a dude blasting gear, but the constant high levels of testosterone in your bloodstream will essentially remove the "natty cap" of your rates of protein synthesis, you'll recover way faster and will be able to just keep progressing at a rate that otherwise you wouldn't if you were training fully natural.

The idea here is pretty simple, nattys have testosterone pulses, it isn't constant, in the case of TRT, your T will be chronically high, allowing for extraordinary rates of protein synthesis.
