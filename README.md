## What Are Biomarkers
Biomarkers are characteristics of the body that you can measure. Example your blood pressure is actually a biomarker.

### Formal definition
*Biomarker is a defined characteristic that’s measured as an indicator of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or responses to an exposure or intervention, including therapeutic interventions.*

Molecular, histologic, radiographic, and physiologic characteristics are types of biomarkers.

Some examples are blood glucose, tumor size, and blood pressure.

#### Biomarkers are divided into seven categories.
Each of these categories lends itself to different uses.
1. Safety
2. Diagnostic
3. Prognostic
4. Susceptibilty / Risk
5. Predictive
6. Pharmacodynamic/ Response
7. Monitoring

For example…
A prognostic biomarker is defined as a biomarker used to identify likelihood of a clinical event, disease recurrence, or progression.
Prognostic biomarkers can be used to select patients with greater likelihood of having a disease-related endpoint event or a substantial worsening in condition in clinical trials. These can be used for patient stratification or enrichment in clinical trials. An example of the use of prognostic biomarkers, utilized for enrichment, is total kidney volume that may be employed to select patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease at high risk for progressive decline in renal function for inclusion in interventional clinical trials.

Some of these biomarkers can be used as surrogate endpoints in clinical trials, based on available evidence. Surrogate endpoint can be defined as an endpoint that’s used in clinical trials as a substitute for a direct measure of how a patient feels, functions, or survives. An example of a validated surrogate endpoint is hemoglobin A1C reduction, used as a surrogate endpoint in diabetes clinical trials.

An example of a reasonably likely surrogate endpoint is radiographic evidence of tumor shrinkage and progression-free survival in certain cancer types to predict an improvement in overall survival.

In relevance to biomarkers, analytical and clinical validation refer to the biomarker test or device and help ensure that the test or device performs as intended.
Validation of a biomarker test or device is a critical step to ensure that the biomarker data are accurate and reproducible.

CDER’s Biomarker Qualification Program is a way to establish a biomarker’s value for a particular context of use in drug development and for regulatory review.
A biomarker used in a typical drug-approval process would have to undergo additional regulatory review before it could be used in another program.

Here’s the advantage of qualification: A biomarker, once qualified for a particular context of use, will be publicly available and can be applied in any drug development program for the qualified context of use.

##### What do we mean by “context of use”?
The context of use is a statement that fully and clearly describes the way the biomarker is to be used in drug development.
The context of use drives the level of evidence, which in turn drives the qualification process, and thus, it’s very important to consider the context of use early in biomarker qualification considerations.

Biomarkers are integral to drug development; they’re really critical, because we need to measure the effects of investigational drugs on people during the clinical trials. And the way we do that is to look at their effect on biomarkers. And so it’s really important that we have a wide range of biomarkers that can measure everything we want to know about the effect of the investigational drug in people.

## What's BEST ("B"iomarkers, "E"ndpoint"S" and other "T"ools)?
Unclear terminology and definitions impede progress. In an effort to harmonize the terminology related to biomarkers, the Joint Leadership Council of FDA and NIH published the BEST Resource in 2016, which is a glossary of terms that could serve as a point of consensus for all stakeholders.


## Why Are They Important for Drug Development? (not important Q for this dashboard app)
Drug development today has many problems, and the major problem is the failure rate. So even drugs that have gone through the whole preclinical process and gone through all sorts of animal testing and all sorts of other types of assays, once they get into people, they have maybe a less than 1 in 10 chance of actually getting on the market. Nine out of 10 may fail during that development. And we have to do better than that if we’re going to accelerate the treatment availability, if we’re going to lower the cost of drug development and not have it continue to escalate, and if we’re actually going to let a lot of innovators into this space of participating in drug development.

To really improve the success rate and improve the efficiency of drug development, we needa whole new generation of biomarkers that are more informative and that can tell developers earlier whether or not their drug may have toxicity or it really may not work at all, and to get that early read on what’s going to be successful. And so those biomarkers are ones that have yet to be developed.
