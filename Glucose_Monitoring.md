# Device

- Components include Sensor, transmitter and reciever.
- Worn 7-14 days depending on device


- Few of the many types of devices
    - Real Time CGM (rtCGM) - Sensor data is monitored and transmitted continously which allows alerts and alarms.
    - Intermittently scanned (isCGM) - Full 24 hrs data is captured but data is available only scanned from a reading device. so no alerts.


# Arrow montoring and alerts
Glucose can increase/decrease less than 1mg in 1 minute.
Glucose can increase/decrease 30 to 60mg, 60 to 90mg, even more than 90mg in 30 minutes.
These are usually not recorded in normal meters and cannot be tracked.

Like below we can find the readings from the chart and gain alerts and suggestions
And based on the alerts we can find the suggestions to normalize the glucose immediately.

# Suggestions

- 7% A1C which is 154mg/dl is considered normal or good.
With alerts and suggestions we can keep it below and above the same.

- Comparing different days data and analyses based what the user did that day, sleep, exercise and so on.
Then helps user follow his body adapting schedule to make it better.

# Q&A
### 1. How expensive are these?
Cost is varying from 8k to 25k to above INR.
https://www.amazon.in/s?k=cgm+devices


### 2. Can i get the data in real time/ near real time on my mobile
Yes.  It offers real time 24 hr monitoring including alerts and suggestions.

### 3. Does it only go to a specific app, or can i get a data dump of this.
Yes. You need to get the app to moniter the data.
You can extract the PDF data which has a detailed report of the same.

Workarounds can be tried to get the data dump but no mention of data exposed.
alternatively PDF data can be read by self made algorithms and data can be extracted.(Need to be tried)

PDF looks like

### 4. Why monitor this?
- Normal meters track only on specific timings. But glucose metrics changes a lot. So it is not that accurate.
- Normal meter's reading vary for the same person when washed hands, 1 alochohal wipe and 5 alcohal wipes. 
So accuracy matters and can be improved by CGM.
Also the readings will differ from noral meter reading due to the same.
- Get suggestions on stabilizing the glucose.
- Different day metrics.



### 5. Should i do this on regular basis if non diabetic, or only for a short period to understand when the spikes are in my day, what eating habits are creating the wrong spikes etc and take corrective actions, then not worry about this for say an year.

Usually person need not wear it all the time.
He can choose to wear it 7-14 days depending on the device. And repeat this 3 to 4 times a year.
They can buy it out or few clinics lend these machines.
Most insurances cover this in US.

But depending on person's criticality he might be prescribed to wear much often.
